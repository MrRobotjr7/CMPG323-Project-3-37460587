# Web Application Enhancement Project

## Overview

This project involves enhancing and improving an existing Web Application that manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for project and client data. The application aims to leverage architectural patterns, coding principles, and design patterns to improve its maintainability, scalability, and overall quality.

## Objectives

- Enhance the existing Web Application to better manage project and client data.
- Implement architectural patterns and design principles to improve code structure and maintainability.
- Apply coding principles and design patterns to ensure the application aligns with best practices.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Manage projects and clients with create, read, update, and delete functionalities.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Use tiered architecture and repository pattern to structure the application.
- **Design Patterns**: Apply design patterns such as Dependency Injection, Singleton, and Factory to enhance code quality.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Ensure the application follows best practices for security and scalability.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and interact with the service layer.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with the repository layer.
- **Repositories**: Manage data access and operations using a repository pattern.
- **Models**: Define the data structures used throughout the application.
- **Views**: Provide the user interface for interacting with the application.

Authentication

If the application requires authentication, ensure you are logged in with the appropriate credentials to access the data and functionalities.
Design and Architecture
Architectural Patterns

    Tiered Architecture: Separates the application into presentation, business logic, and data access layers.
    Repository Pattern: Encapsulates data access and operations.

Design Patterns

    Dependency Injection: Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability.
    Singleton: Manages a single instance of services where needed.
    Factory: Creates instances of objects based on specific requirements.
